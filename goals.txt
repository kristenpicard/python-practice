KNOWLEDGE:
1. be able to tell me the 3 primative data types you know
2. be able to tell me the 5 primative arrithmatic operators are in python
3. be able to tell me what the 2 additional primative operators are in python that build on the 5 
5. be able to tell me what if/else statements are used for
6. be able to tell me what the 6 comparison (think if/else) operators are in python
7. be able to tell me what the 3 logical (think if/else) operators are in python 
8. be able to tell me what 2 loops you have learned, what the difference is, and when to use each and why
9. be able to tell me what a function does and how to write and use one
10. be able to tell me what recursion is, why you would use it, and how you use is
11. be able to tell me what a class does, why and when you would use it, how to use a class
12. be able to tell me what a list is, why and when you would use it, and how you access its elements
13. be able to tell me how to use 2 objects for different classes together
14. be able to tell me what class inheritance is, why its useful, and when and how to use it

PRACTICAL:
1. be able to build basic functions on your own using each of the data types you know
2. be able to use if/else statements to solve problems
3. be able to use for & while loops or recursive functions appropriately

6. be able to solve the perfect shuffle problem (or similar) on your own
7. be able to build multiiple classes & objects (with/without inheritance) to solve a problems on your own
